## Overview

Peakdet is designed for use in analysis and interpretation of physiological recordings (e.g., respiration/pulse waveforms, ECG recordings).

## Installation

Cloning the repo from GitHub and running the usual `python setup.py install` should work.

## Credit

Many of the behind-the-scenes functions in `peakdet` are translated from the [physIO](http://www.translationalneuromodeling.org/tnu-checkphysretroicor-toolbox/) MATLAB toolbox. Consider this an imperfect translation and wrapping of their code, and cite their code: [Kasper et al., 2017](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016502701630259X).
