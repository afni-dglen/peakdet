Using peakdet
=============

The API of ``peakdet`` is under active development, so it's not quite stable
enough for example usage instructions. Try taking a look at the :ref:`api_ref`
to get an idea about the available functions and methods. If you're *super
eager* to get started, try `opening an issue <https://github.com/rmarkello/
peakdet/issues>`_  to let the developers know there's external interest in these
sorts of things. Otherwise, check back soon!
